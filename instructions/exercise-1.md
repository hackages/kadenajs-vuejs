## Introduction to KadenaJS

In this Jam, we are going to learn how to use KadenaJS.

We just assume you have a good understanding of JavaScript or TypeScript.
No background in Blockchain development is required.

Here are the 2 modules we will be playing with during this Jam session:

- @kadena/pactjs
- @kadena/client

### How a Jam works?

- Install all dependencies `npm install`
- Launch the app `npm start` and go to http://localhost:3000/
- Run the tests `npm test` or `npm start  -- --watch` then press `a` to run all tests.
- Once your work is done, please **commit** and **push** `git add src && git commit -m "Exercise completed" && git push origin` to our server.

### Exercise 1

### Todo: List all modules available on testnet04

As the title suggest, we will just explore the TestNet 04 with our Kadena Client.

We provide you with a function called `listModules` in `[module-explorer](./module-explorer.ts)`.

Implement that function. We provided some extra information within the file itself.

Once you are done with the implementation, you should commit your code and push it to our server.

We will take it from there, analyse it and suggest some improvements if needed.

If all goes well, you should see a final screen with your newly acquired KDALT token.

Later on, you will be able to make use of your token and get a NFT certificate after completing
Jams on this platform.
